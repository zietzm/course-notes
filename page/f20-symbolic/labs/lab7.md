Just kidding.

I appreciate all your hard work so far on the labs and the midterm, especially.
This week will have a very simple assignment.

1. Tell me how you think you'll use symbolic methods in the future (after this class ends).
If you don't think you'll use them in the future, explain why.
(~200 words)
2. I want this class to be valuable for you. Do you have any feedback about the course for me? (e.g. labs, class, assignments, etc.) Is there anything you want to cover that we haven't covered or aren't scheduled to cover?
