## Admin

Since we only have two labs remaining, this lab has two unrelated components.
Submit on Canvas in whatever format you like.

## Intro

<span class="newthought">Last week</span> you created phenotype definitions for several conditions.
This week, we heard Patrick Ryan walk through some phenotypes.
One task will be to improve your phenotype definitions according to what Patrick showed.

Reference and interface terminologies are powerful and complementary tools in informatics.
We heard Andy Kanter talk about these yesterday in class.
You'll create a simple example of each.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Refine your phenotype definitions

Revisit your phenotypes from last week.
Explain why and how you would refine your phenotype definitions based on what Patrick Ryan showed in class{% include sidenote.html id="eg" note="For example, you might add measurements, require multiple observations of a code, use different codes, add prescriptions, demographic information, etc."%}.
What kinds of things could you add to the definitions that would improve the sensitivity and specificity of your definitions{% include sidenote.html id="improve" note="Note, you don't actually have to recreate the phenotype definitions; just tell me what you would do differently and why."%}?
If you were forced to guess, how much better do you think the new definitions would be?
Do you think it would make a big difference or not, and why?
Try to write at least 350 words on this.

### Part 2: Reference and interface terminologies

Pick something that interests you for which you could build a terminology.{% include sidenote.html id="eg-term" note="Examples: kidney diseases, pizza, ski equipment, your favorite RNA viruses, TV show characters, Emacs features, etc. Anything you're interested in and that doesn't give you a headache after five minutes."%}
{% include marginfigure.html id="nb1" url="/page/f20-symbolic/img/pizza_02.png" description="Example of a visualization from the first lab. I made this in Google Drawings." %}
Make a reference terminology with at least 20 entries{% include sidenote.html id="hier" note="Ideally including hierarchy."%}.
Make an interface terminology with at least 25 entries.
Show these in a way that illustrates the relationships between and within the two terminologies{% include sidenote.html id="eg-viz" note="For example, a chart with boxes and lines, a table, etc."%}.

Explain why anyone would ever need two types of terminology for the same thing.
Outline the differences between the terminologies you created.
Come up with a hypothetical use for each terminology{% include sidenote.html id="eg-term" note="These may be a bit contrived, just illustrate the point."%}.
Try to write at least 150 words on this.

### Part 3: Quick check-in

How is your course project going{% include sidenote.html id="eg-viz" note="I also do course projects at the last minute, so, \"We haven't done anything,\" is perfectly fine with me."%}?
Can I help your team in any way?
Any problems you're struggling with or didn't anticipate?
