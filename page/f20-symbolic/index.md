These notes are for BINF 4003 - Methods III: Symbolic Methods, taught in the Fall of 2020 at Columbia University.

## Overview

1. [Introduction](introduction): What are symbolic methods? Data-Information-Knowledge hierarchy, interoperability, "curly braces problem".

2. [Knowledge representation](knowledge-representation): Medical knowledge representations, closed vs open world assumptions, reference vs interface terminologies, pre- vs post-coordination.

3. [Desiderata for medical vocabularies](desiderata): Characteristics of high-quality controlled medical vocabularies.

## Specific terminologies and tools

1. [ICD](icd): Design, structure, limitations, adoption, versions: ICD-9, ICD-10, clinical modification.

2. [SNOMED](snomed): Design, structure, limitations, adoption, SNOMED clinical terms (SNOMED CT).

3. [RxNorm](rxnorm): Design, structure, data sources, use cases. RxNorm vs RxTerm.

4. [HPO](hpo): Human Phenotype Ontology

5. [UMLS](umls): Three knowledge sources: Metathesaurus, Semantic Network, SPECIALIST Lexicon and Lexical Tools. Purpose, data sources, use cases.

6. [Concept mapping](concept-mapping): MetaMap, Usagi, BioAnnotator

## Labs

I've tried to make the examples you'll work through both practical and helpful.
We'll work through lots of things, including actual database query design problems I've encountered in research.

1. [Lab 1: Setup and test computing environment, improve example terminology](lab1)
2. [Lab 2: Phenotyping in ICD-9](lab2)
3. [Lab 3: ICD-10 and SNOMED-CT](lab3)
4. [Lab 4: Example study on drug safety](lab4)
5. [Lab 5: Example use of the HPO](lab5)
6. [Lab 6: Terminology exercise](lab6)
7. [Lab 7: UMLS Metathesaurus example task](lab7)
8. [Lab 8: OMOP CDM example 1](lab8)
9. [Lab 9: OMOP CDM example 2](lab9)
